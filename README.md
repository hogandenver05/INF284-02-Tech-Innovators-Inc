# Tech Innovators Inc. Network Design - Group 6
Contributors: **Denver Hogan** and **Parker Crawford** 

## Project Overview

This project involves designing a network for **Tech Innovators Inc.**, which has two office buildings (Alpha and Beta) on the same campus in Alexandria. The two buildings have separate networks, but they need to be interconnected, allowing devices in both buildings to communicate with each other.

### Group 6 Network ID

- **Network ID**: 128.3.0.0/17
- **Subnet Mask**: 255.255.128.0

## Key Requirements

- **Alpha Building**:
  - Wired Network: 10 desktop PCs, file server, and printer.
  - Wireless Network: 5 laptops connected wirelessly.
  - DHCP server to manage IP address allocation.
  
- **Beta Building**:
  - Wired Network: Application server, project management software, sales software, and customer support software.
  - Wireless Network: 4 laptops/tablets.
  - DHCP server to manage IP address allocation.

- **Network Segmentation**: Secure the wireless networks and ensure that devices across subnets can communicate with each other.

- **IP Addressing**: Use the network ID assigned to Group 6 (128.3.0.0/17) and avoid IP address overlaps across subnets.
